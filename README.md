# Smart University Timetable Scheduler

## Project Description

The **Smart University Timetable Scheduler** is a desktop application developed using Python and the `ttkbootstrap` library. It allows universities to manage and create timetables for courses, teachers, and students with ease. The app provides a user-friendly interface for adding courses, teachers, and scheduling classes, while ensuring that the scheduling system is efficient and organized.

This application also supports the management of teacher availability and course assignments. It connects to a local MySQL database for storing course and teacher data.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Built using `ttkbootstrap` for a modern, clean look and feel.
- **Add and Manage Courses**: Easily add courses to the system and store them in a MySQL database.
- **Add Teachers**: Assign teachers to courses with the ability to manage teacher availability.
- **Timetable Creation**: Automatically generate and manage timetables for courses and teachers.
- **Flexible Teacher Availability**: Teachers can select their available days for classes.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes MySQL to store and manage course and teacher data.
- **Smooth UI Transitions**: Supports seamless UI transitions for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Main programming language.
- **ttkbootstrap**: For styling and creating the modern user interface.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing courses, teachers, and their schedules.
- **tkinter**: Python's standard library for building the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x (preferably 3.7 or above)
- MySQL Server (e.g., XAMPP for easy MySQL setup)
- `ttkbootstrap` library installed via pip.

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevSahil01/Smart-University-TimeTable-Schedular.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Smart-University-TimeTable-Schedular
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install ttkbootstrap mysql-connector-python
   ```

4. Set up MySQL Database:
   - Create a database and tables in MySQL to store course and teacher data. Refer to the `database_setup.sql` file in the repository.

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the application, and you can start managing the timetable for your university.

## Database Schema

The MySQL database has two key tables:

- **Courses**:
  - `course_id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
  - `course_name` (VARCHAR)

- **Teachers**:
  - `teacher_id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
  - `teacher_name` (VARCHAR)
  - `course_id` (Foreign Key linked to the `Courses` table)
  - `available_days` (VARCHAR, stores the days a teacher is available)

## Usage

1. **Add Course**: Add a new course to the database with its name.
2. **Add Teacher**: Add a teacher to the system, assign a course, and specify available days.
3. **Generate Timetable**: Generate and view the timetable for the courses and teachers.
